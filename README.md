<details>
<summary>Quick start</summary>

If you have a clean install or have an empty `.config`.

```sh
paru -S stow mako fish btop kitty neovim yazi rofi-wayland swayfx swaybg swaylock-effects waybar autotiling-rs grim slurp jq --needed && sudo chsh $(whoami) -s /bin/fish && git clone https://github.com/WilliamAnimate/....git --depth=1 && cd ... && stow . && curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorgebucaran/fisher/main/functions/fisher.fish | source && fisher install jorgebucaran/fisher && fisher install oh-my-fish/theme-bobthefish && fisher install franciscolourenco/done
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you use Artix, you need a modified pkgbuild to build swayfx. you need to change the dbus impl to libelogind

also i know github markdown is broken here, github skill issue

## Install GNU stow and curl (for downloading fisher)

```sh
pacman -S stow curl --needed
```

## then find out the other deps it has.

```sh
paru -S mako fish btop kitty neovim yazi rofi-wayland swayfx swaybg swaylock-effects waybar autotiling-rs grim slurp jq --needed
```

### or if you like yay...

```sh
rm -rf ~
```

### or if you like [nyaur](https://github.com/williamAnimate/nyaur)...

```sh
echo "there is something wrong with me"
```

### or if you like pacman

```sh
# TODO: download aur pkgs from pacman somehow.
```

## Then, change shell to fish shell, the best shell that will ever exist.

```sh
sudo chsh $(whoami) -s /bin/fish
```

## Then, clone this repo...

```sh
git clone https://github.com/WilliamAnimate/....git --depth=1
```

## Then, switch view into it

```sh
cd ...
```

## symlink em' all

```sh
stow .
```

> [!NOTE]
> This command may fail if you already have some of your own dots in `.config`. If that is the case, move the conflicting files out of the `.config` directory and try again.
> stow **cannot** overwrite existing files as far as im aware, so you need not worry.

<!-- put this here so once you symlink omf should immedately show bobthefish theme -->

## et enfin, install [fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) and themes and plugins

```sh
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorgebucaran/fisher/main/functions/fisher.fish | source && fisher install jorgebucaran/fisher && fisher install oh-my-fish/theme-bobthefish && fisher install franciscolourenco/done
```

fisher is used over omf because omf is deprecated and unmaintained.

## haha jk not finally. you need to then find the fira code nerd font

idk where to find it. perhaps [google](https://google.com) it yourself. (or [duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com) it yourself)

## Further configuration

more bloat! woooooooooooo

### Yazi: add what-size plugin for yazi

Trigger it with `.s`. You can configure it in `.config/yazi/keymap.toml`

```sh
ya pack -a 'pirafrank/what-size'
```

### delete my system

```sh
sudo rm -rf /*
```
